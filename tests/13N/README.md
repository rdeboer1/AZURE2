# 13N — the reference evaluation

The `12C + p` system: capture, elastic scattering, and the vector analyzing
power. Small enough to run in seconds, but it exercises most of the physics —
particle and photon channels, external capture, target integration, energy
shifts, angular distributions, and polarization.

`run_tests.sh` runs a plain calculation and compares the total and per-segment
chi-squared against `expected/chiSquared.out`.

**Re-baselined 2026-09-11.** Segments 1 and 2 carry the gas-target integration,
and their reference was recorded at a resonance-width multiplier of 5, which
does not converge the integral: the fine lattice has to span enough energy for
the sub-point grid to resolve the resonance. The project's `<targetInt>` line
now asks for 20, where the result is flat out to 200 and reproduced
independently by refining the lattice pitch, and where the code agrees with
itself as it stood before the resonance-width estimator was corrected
(813.30 / 39.69 against 814.44 / 39.71). Segments 1 and 2 moved from
823.88 / 24.335 to 814.44 / 39.706; every other segment is unchanged to the
digits recorded here. See `../../include/AdaptiveIntegrationGrid.h` for why the
default multiplier is now 20.

## Segments

| # | data | observable |
|---|---|---|
| 1–2 | Artemov, Seagrave | angle-integrated capture |
| 3–5 | Meyer, at 84.3°, 114.5°, 144.1° | differential |
| 6–8 | Skowronski (LUNA HPGe, LUNA BGO, FELS) | angle-integrated |
| 9–10 | Kettner, at 0° and 55° | differential |
| 11–16 | Baumann, at six energies | **analyzing power** |

Segments 1–10 are the capture and scattering evaluation. Segments 11–16 were
added to cover the analyzing power (observable 7) against measured data; they
are the same compound nucleus and the same particle pairs, which is why they
live here rather than in an evaluation of their own.

## The analyzing-power data

R. Baumann, G. Keil, N. Kniest, E. Pfaff, M. Preiss, M. Skill and G. Clausnitzer,
*The analyzing power for elastic 12C(p,p)12C scattering below 2.1 MeV*,
Nucl. Phys. **A542** (1992) 53.

The paper publishes no table of A_y — its results are contour plots (figs. 3
and 4) plus six angular distributions in fig. 1, at E_p = 1.618, 1.658, 1.708,
1.738, 1.758 and 1.779 MeV. The six `data/baumann_*.dat` files are those panels
digitised: 178 points in all, 24 to 38 per energy, spanning 1° to 177°.

Two things this data is not, both of which matter when reading a fit:

* **These are samples of the drawn curve, not the measured points.** Baumann
  measured at ten angles between 40° and 160°; the files span 1° to 177° with up
  to 38 points per energy. What is sampled is therefore the curve of the paper's
  phase-shift analysis, which is smooth and defined over the full angular range.
  Neighbouring points are strongly correlated, and there are far more of them
  than there were measurements.

* **The uncertainties are 10% of the value, sign included.** 50 of the 178 are
  therefore negative, and the smallest is 1.6e-5. A relative uncertainty is the
  wrong model for an analyzing power: a point where A_y passes through zero does
  not have a vanishing uncertainty. This is what drives the chi-squared to
  336516 for the evaluation as a whole, and to 40.6 per point in the fit below.
  A roughly constant absolute uncertainty, of order the digitisation precision,
  would be the physical choice.

Angles are centre-of-mass, as printed on the figure axis, which is what
observable 7 expects; energies are laboratory. One segment per energy keeps each
angular distribution separately plottable, as in the paper's figure.

## Reproducing the analyzing-power fit

The evaluation as shipped is fitted to everything, so its levels sit at the
values the capture and scattering data want. Fitting A_y *alone* is a separate
exercise and a useful check that the polarization observable carries real
information:

```python
import re, pathlib
s = pathlib.Path("13N.azr").read_text()

# every level fixed except the two resonances this energy range sees
def levels(b):
    out = []
    for line in b.splitlines():
        f = line.split()
        if len(f) >= 12:
            free = f[2] in ("3.5032", "3.5453")
            f[3]  = "0" if free else "1"
            f[10] = "0" if (free and f[5] == "1") else "1"
            line = "  ".join(f)
        out.append(line)
    return "\n".join(out)
s = re.sub(r'(<levels>\n)(.*?)(</levels>)',
           lambda m: m.group(1) + levels(m.group(2)) + "\n" + m.group(3), s, flags=re.S)

# only the analyzing-power segments active
def segs(b):
    out = []
    for line in b.splitlines():
        if not line.strip():
            continue
        f = line.split()
        f[0] = "1" if f[7] == "7" else "0"
        out.append("  ".join(f))
    return "\n".join(out)
s = re.sub(r'(<segmentsData>\n)(.*?)(</segmentsData>)',
           lambda m: m.group(1) + segs(m.group(2)) + "\n" + m.group(3), s, flags=re.S)
pathlib.Path("_ay_only.azr").write_text(s)
```

Then `printf '2\n\nn\n\n' | AZURE2 --no-gui --no-readline _ay_only.azr`.

This finds both resonances:

| parameter | fitted | Baumann table 1 | start |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3/2⁻ E_x | 3.5079 MeV | 3.499 MeV | 3.5032 MeV |
| 3/2⁻ Γ_p | 41.9 keV | 57 keV | 55.2 keV |
| 5/2⁺ E_x | 3.5444 MeV | 3.546 MeV | 3.5453 MeV |
| 5/2⁺ Γ_p | 45.8 keV | 50 keV | 49.0 keV |

The excitation energies come out well — 9 keV and 2 keV from the published
values — which is the real result: an R-matrix model fitted to A_y alone lands
on the same two states from the correct side.

The widths do not, and the reason is the uncertainty model rather than the
physics. Chi-squared per point is 40.6, so the fit is not describing the data
within its stated errors at all; the points where A_y passes near zero carry
uncertainties of order 1e-5 and dominate everything else, pulling both widths
low. Re-quoting the uncertainties as a constant absolute value should be done
before these numbers are taken seriously.

## Two traps this evaluation illustrates

**`<targetInt>` assigns target effects by segment index**, and `<segmentsTest>`
shares that numbering with `<segmentsData>`. The analyzing-power segments were
appended after the ten existing ones precisely so they would not inherit the
gas-target integration declared for segments 1 and 2. That matters more here
than it would for a cross section: A_y averaged over a target is weighted by
the cross section, and since Rutherford scattering diverges at low energy where
A_y is essentially zero, a thick target drives the average to about 1e-6.

**`<parameterSettings>` is also keyed by segment number.** This file previously
carried entries for segments 11 through 18, left over from a configuration that
had more segments than it does now. They were harmless only until a segment 11
existed — at which point a new data set silently inherited another segment's
nuisance prior and a freed normalization. They have been removed, and AZURE2
now drops settings entries numbered beyond the segments that actually exist.
