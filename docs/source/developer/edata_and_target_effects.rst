EData, Data Points, and Target Effects
=======================================

This page describes how experimental data is managed internally and how
target integration, beam convolution, and straggling effects are applied.
This is essential reading for anyone working on improvements to the
convolution routines.

Data Structure Overview
-----------------------

The data hierarchy from top to bottom:

``EData``
   Top-level container. Holds all segments, target effects, and manages the
   overall calculation loop. One ``EData`` object exists per calculation; it is
   cloned for thread-safe parallel fitting.

``ESegment``
   A calculation segment corresponding to a specific entrance/exit particle
   pair, energy range, angle range, and data type. Contains a vector of
   ``EPoint`` objects.

``EPoint``
   A single data point with energy, angle, cross section, and uncertainty.
   When target effects are active, an ``EPoint`` also holds a vector of
   **sub-points** (``integrationPoints_``) used for numerical integration.

``TargetEffect``
   Configuration for experimental effect corrections: Gaussian convolution
   parameters, stopping power equation, density, Q-coefficients, straggling,
   and the number of integration sub-points.

**Key files:**

- ``include/EData.h``, ``src/EData.cpp``
- ``include/ESegment.h``, ``src/ESegment.cpp``
- ``include/EPoint.h``, ``src/EPoint.cpp``
- ``include/TargetEffect.h``, ``src/TargetEffect.cpp``
- ``include/AdaptiveIntegrationGrid.h``, ``src/AdaptiveIntegrationGrid.cpp``

Data Loading and Initialization
-------------------------------

EData::Fill()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``EData::Fill()`` method (in ``src/EData.cpp``) orchestrates the loading
and initialization of all data:

1. **Read data files** -- for each data segment, parse the four-column data
   file and create ``EPoint`` objects for data points that fall within the
   segment's energy and angle ranges.

2. **Convert to CM frame** -- laboratory energies and angles are converted to
   center-of-mass frame values using the kinematics of the entrance/exit pair.

3. **Map duplicate points** -- if multiple segments reference the same
   physical point (same energy, angle, and reaction), the point is calculated
   only once and other occurrences are mapped to it via ``EnergyMap``.

4. **Create sub-points** -- for each data point that has an associated target
   effect, a grid of sub-points is generated for numerical integration
   (see below).

5. **Initialize sub-points** -- each sub-point's energy-dependent quantities
   (penetrabilities, Coulomb phases, shift functions) are pre-computed via
   ``EPoint::Initialize()``.

Sub-Point Creation
------------------

When a data point has a target effect, the code creates a grid of sub-points
spanning the energy range needed for integration. The sub-points are stored
inside the parent ``EPoint`` in the ``integrationPoints_`` vector.

Energy Range Determination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sub-point energy range depends on which effects are active:

**Target integration only:**

- From the beam energy (surface) down by the target thickness:

  .. math::

     E_\text{back} = E_\text{CM} - \Delta E_\text{target}

  where :math:`\Delta E_\text{target} = \epsilon(E) \cdot \rho` is the target
  thickness computed from the stopping power :math:`\epsilon(E)` and the
  areal density :math:`\rho`.
- Forward depth is zero (no energy above beam energy).

**Gaussian convolution only:**

- Symmetric range around the beam energy:

  .. math::

     E_\text{range} = E_\text{CM} \pm n_\sigma \cdot \sigma_b

  where :math:`\sigma_b` is the beam energy resolution (Gaussian sigma) and
  :math:`n_\sigma` is the ``convolutionRange`` parameter (typically 5).

**Target integration + convolution:**

- Backward: target thickness plus the convolution tail:

  .. math::

     E_\text{back} = E_\text{CM} - \Delta E_\text{target} - n_\sigma \cdot \sigma_b

- Forward: convolution tail above the beam energy:

  .. math::

     E_\text{forward} = E_\text{CM} + n_\sigma \cdot \sigma_b

**Straggling:**

When straggling is enabled, the backward range is further extended by the
straggling width at the back of the target:

.. math::

   \sigma_\text{straggling} = c_s \sqrt{\Delta E_\text{target}}

where :math:`c_s` is the straggling coefficient (in keV units).

Adaptive Grid Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   The grids are built in ``EData::Fill``, which runs *before* the input
   parameter transformation, so at that moment ``ALevel::GetGamma`` still
   returns the values read from the file (an observed partial width in eV for
   an open particle channel, an ANC for a closed one, :math:`\Gamma_\gamma`
   in eV for a photon channel), not reduced-width amplitudes.
   ``GridConfig::inputWidthsArePhysical`` (set from
   ``Config::TRANSFORM_PARAMETERS`` and ``CNuc::IsTransformedIn``) tells
   ``IdentifyResonances`` to sum those widths directly; treating them as
   amplitudes made every estimate degenerate to :math:`2P/(dS/dE)` and left
   narrow resonances unresolved (a 0.6 keV 2\ :sup:`+` in :sup:`12`\ C+α was
   reported 0.8 MeV wide).


Sub-points are placed on an **adaptive energy grid** generated by the
``AdaptiveIntegrationGrid`` class. The grid is denser near resonances and
coarser in smooth regions:

1. **Resonance detection** -- the generator scans all compound nucleus levels
   and identifies resonances that fall within the integration range. For each
   resonance, the total width :math:`\Gamma` is estimated from the reduced
   width amplitudes.

2. **Step size calculation** -- the local step size varies smoothly using a
   Gaussian falloff:

   .. math::

      \Delta E = \Delta E_\text{fine} \cdot e^{-d^2/2\sigma_r^2}
      + \Delta E_\text{base} \cdot (1 - e^{-d^2/2\sigma_r^2})

   where :math:`d` is the distance to the nearest resonance,
   :math:`\Delta E_\text{fine} = \Gamma / N_\text{ppw}` (points per width),
   and :math:`\sigma_r = \Gamma \cdot M / 2` (with :math:`M` being a multiplier).
   This ensures narrow resonances get a fine grid without discontinuities.

3. **Grid construction** -- starting from the highest energy, points are placed
   at adaptively determined intervals down to the lowest energy. The total
   number of points is bounded by ``maxPoints`` (the user-specified integration
   points count).

Each sub-point is an ``EPoint`` object with:

- The same angle as the parent point.
- Energy set to the grid point energy.
- Stopping power pre-computed at that energy (for target integration).

Calculation Flow for Target Effects
------------------------------------

During calculation (in ``AZURECalc``), the processing of a point with target
effects follows this order:

1. **Calculate each sub-point** -- the R-matrix cross section is computed at
   each sub-point energy by calling ``EPoint::Calculate()`` on each sub-point.
   This runs the full FillMatrices/InvertMatrices/CalculateTMatrix/
   CalculateCrossSection pipeline for each sub-point.

2. **Integrate** -- ``EPoint::IntegrateTargetEffect()`` is called on the parent
   point to numerically integrate the sub-point cross sections, yielding the
   effective yield that accounts for target and beam effects.

Integration Methods
-------------------

The integration is implemented in ``EPoint::IntegrateTargetEffect()``
(``src/EPoint.cpp``). All cases use **2-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature** on
each sub-interval, which is exact for cubic polynomials and handles
non-uniform (adaptive) grids correctly.

Cross section values between grid points are obtained by **linear
interpolation** from the two nearest sub-points.

Convolution Only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For pure Gaussian convolution (no target integration), the yield at beam
energy :math:`E_0` is:

.. math::

   Y(E_0) = \int \sigma(E') \cdot g(E' - E_0) \, dE'

where :math:`g` is the Gaussian beam profile:

.. math::

   g(E' - E_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\,\sigma_b}
   \exp\!\left(-\frac{(E' - E_0)^2}{2\sigma_b^2}\right)

**Implementation:** The code loops over consecutive sub-point pairs
:math:`[E_i, E_{i+1}]`. For each interval, two Gauss-Legendre points are
evaluated. At each Gauss point, the cross section is linearly interpolated
from the bracketing sub-points, multiplied by the Gaussian convolution factor
(``TargetEffect::GetConvolutionFactor()``), and accumulated into the integral.

Target Integration Only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For target integration without convolution, the yield is:

.. math::

   Y(E_0) = \int_{E_0 - \Delta}^{E_0} \frac{\sigma(E')}{\epsilon(E')} \, dE'

where :math:`\epsilon(E')` is the stopping cross section. The integral runs
from the beam energy at the target surface down to the energy at the back of
the target.

**Implementation:** Similar Gauss-Legendre quadrature over sub-intervals,
but the integrand is :math:`\sigma / \epsilon` (cross section divided by
stopping power). Only intervals within the target range
:math:`[E_\text{back}, E_\text{surface}]` contribute.

Target Integration + Convolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The full nested integral is:

.. math::

   Y(E_0) = \frac{1}{\rho} \int_{E_\text{back}}^{E_\text{surface}}
   \left[\int \frac{\sigma(E')}{\epsilon(E')} \cdot g(E' - E_d) \, dE'\right] dE_d

This is a **double integral**: the outer integral runs over target depth
(energy loss), and the inner integral convolves the cross section with the
beam energy distribution at each depth.

**Implementation:** Two nested Gauss-Legendre loops:

1. **Outer loop** (target depth): iterates over sub-point intervals within
   the target range :math:`[E_\text{back}, E_\text{surface}]`. At each Gauss
   point :math:`E_d`, the effective beam sigma is computed (including
   straggling if enabled).

2. **Inner loop** (convolution): for each depth :math:`E_d`, integrates
   :math:`\sigma(E')/\epsilon(E') \cdot g(E' - E_d)` over the range
   :math:`E_d \pm n_\sigma \cdot \sigma_\text{eff}`, where
   :math:`\sigma_\text{eff}` includes both beam resolution and straggling:

   .. math::

      \sigma_\text{eff} = \sqrt{\sigma_b^2 + \sigma_\text{straggling}^2}

   The straggling contribution grows with depth:

   .. math::

      \sigma_\text{straggling} = c_s \sqrt{E_\text{surface} - E_d}

Target Integration + Straggling (no beam convolution)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When straggling is enabled but Gaussian beam convolution is not, the code
uses the same nested double integral structure, but the convolution kernel
is purely from straggling (no beam sigma component). At the target surface
(:math:`\sigma_\text{straggling} = 0`), the inner integral reduces to a
direct :math:`\sigma/\epsilon` evaluation (no spreading).

Key Helper Functions
--------------------

``TargetEffect::GetConvolutionFactor(energy, centroid)``
   Returns the Gaussian weight :math:`g(E - E_0)` for a fixed sigma.

``TargetEffect::CalculateConvolutionFactor(energy, centroid, config)``
   Returns the Gaussian weight with an energy-dependent sigma (evaluated from
   a user-provided equation).

``TargetEffect::TargetThickness(energy, config)``
   Returns :math:`\epsilon(E) \cdot \rho` -- the product of stopping power
   and density.

``TargetEffect::GetStoppingPowerEq()``
   Returns the ``Equation`` object for the parametrized stopping cross section
   (user-defined functional form with parameters ``a0``, ``a1``, ...).

``AdaptiveIntegrationGrid::GenerateGrid(startEnergy, endEnergy, compound)``
   Generates an adaptive energy grid with finer spacing near resonances.
   Returns a ``std::vector<double>`` of energies from high to low.

Beam-profile kernel
-------------------

``TargetEffect`` carries an optional beam-profile kernel (``IsBeamProfile``):
skewed-Gaussian components ``BeamProfileComponent {xi, omega, alpha, weight}``,
a detector resolution ``beamTpcSigma_``, a truncation and a
detailed-balance flag, parsed from the ``beamprofile`` keyword block at the
end of the ``targetInt`` line (older readers stop in front of the keyword).
``EData::ReadTargetEffectsFile`` converts its energies lab → c.m. once
(``ConvertBeamProfileToCM``) and sizes the sub-point grid from
``BeamProfileSupport`` intersected with the point's window ± 4 s.  The window
comes from ``DataLine`` extras (columns 5–6, ``EPoint::HasBinWindow``), is
converted with the point in ``ConvertLabEnergy`` and stored unshifted; the
branch in ``EPoint::IntegrateTargetEffect`` shifts it by the segment's current
c.m. energy shift, normalises numerically (numerator and denominator on the
same Gauss–Legendre points) and applies the detailed-balance weight from the
kinematics stored by ``EPoint::SetPhotoKinematics``.
``TargetEffect::IsSubPointEffect`` is the single gate for every effect that
integrates over sub-points; ``EPoint::IntegrateTargetEffectComponents``
re-runs the combiner on the E1 and E2 components for isDiff 5/6 segments.

On the GUI side the block lives in ``TargetIntData`` (``gui/include/TargetIntModel.h``,
columns 22-26 of the table model) and is parsed and emitted by
``TargetIntTab::readFile``/``writeFile``.  The reader splits the block off at
its keyword *before* the quoted ranges token is handled, so the older numeric
chain parses exactly as it did; the writer emits it last and only when the
effect declares one, and formats the numbers with ``QString::number(v, 'g', 12)``
because ``QTextStream``'s default of six significant digits would round a
profile location of a few MeV on every save.  A block that declares more
components than it supplies is dropped rather than half-applied.

Energy ranges, blending and the automatic decision
--------------------------------------------------

``TargetEffect`` optionally carries lab-energy windows, a blend width and a
relative tolerance (three trailing tokens of the ``targetInt`` line).  During
``EData`` fill, a point whose blend weight is zero never receives the effect
number, so the rest of the machinery treats it as an ordinary point.  A
parent point with a fractional weight, or a positive tolerance, first
computes its bare value from a probe copy of itself that pretends not to
carry the effect; edge blending mixes the integrated and bare values with a
smoothstep weight, and the automatic decision probes the first, central and
last sub-point to estimate the size of the effect (curvature across the
window, plus the centroid shift under target integration), using the bare
value outright when the estimate is below the tolerance.  Points with mapped
observables skip only when every mapped observable passes its own estimate.

The combined branch of ``EPoint::IntegrateTargetEffect`` accepts either
convolution flavour: a fixed beam sigma, or the energy-dependent convolution
equation evaluated at each depth energy.  The latter combination used to fall
through to pure target integration on a grid sized for the convolution,
corrupting the yield.
