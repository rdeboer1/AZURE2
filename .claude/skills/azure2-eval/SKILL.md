name: azure2-eval
description: Run AZURE2 R-matrix evaluations of nuclear reaction/scattering data — calculate cross sections & chi-squared, fit levels/widths, add/remove levels, decompose a cross section into level/interference/external contributions, extrapolate, compute reaction rates, or drive AZURE2 from Python via pyazr. Use whenever the task involves an .azr project file, AZURE2 levels/channels/segments, R-matrix fitting, S-factors, resonance significance tests, or the worked examples in pyazr/examples/.

# Running AZURE2 evaluations

AZURE2 is a multi-channel, multi-level R-matrix code. An evaluation is driven by
a single `.azr` project file that describes the compound nucleus, particle
pairs, levels/channels, and data segments. Two headless ways to run it: the
**interactive CLI** (`--no-gui`) and the **pyazr** Python API. Use the CLI for a
one-shot calculate/fit/extrapolate/rate that writes the standard output files;
use **pyazr for all evaluation work** — χ², parameter scans, level add/remove
tests, cross-section decomposition, custom fitters and samplers.

**pyazr does not run the binary.** The engine is compiled into the extension
module `pyazr/_azure2` and runs in your interpreter, so there is no path to
resolve and nothing to keep in step — a rebuild of `_azure2` *is* the update.
The CLI binary (`build/src/AZURE2`) is a separate artefact, used only for
Workflow A.

`pyazr/` lives at the repo root and is mirrored into evaluation directories, so
`from pyazr import ...` works when cwd is either. Its version is
`pyazr.__version__`; do not assume one.

Reference docs: `docs/source/` — `reference/` covers command_line,
data_formats, output_files; `user_guide/` covers levels_channels, segments,
particle_pairs, fitting, mcmc, pyazr. Worked examples: `pyazr/examples/`;
runnable projects: `tests/13N`, `tests/13N_capture_ay`, `tests/hybrid_potential`.

## Golden rules

- **Particle pair masses must be precise atomic masses, not bare mass numbers.**
  The GUI's "Particle Pairs" tab labels the field "Mass (M)" and glosses it as
  "the mass number," but the underlying field (`PPair` in the source) is a
  `double` in atomic mass units, u — every downstream kinematic quantity
  (reduced mass, CM/lab conversion, penetrabilities, phase space) is computed
  from whatever value is actually entered there. Typing the integer mass
  number (e.g. `4` for an alpha) instead of the true mass (`4.002602`) silently
  degrades precision throughout the fit. Look up and enter the real value from
  the **latest Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME)** for both particles of every pair,
  not a rounded mass number — the Separation Energy field is entered
  independently and precisely already, so an imprecise particle mass is an easy
  thing to overlook as the one remaining low-precision input.
- **Input is LAB frame, forward kinematics** (light particle = projectile).
  **All output files and API results are CENTER-OF-MASS.** Never mix them.
  This includes `add_extrapolation(e_min, e_max, e_step)` — those are **lab**
  energies (multiply c.m. by `(m_beam + m_target)/m_target`), while the energies
  that come *back* from `calculate_energies` are c.m. **The silent-failure mode
  to watch for**: requesting a lab-frame `e_max` and later comparing the
  returned (c.m.-frame) energy column against that same number looks exactly
  like a hard extrapolation ceiling — the run doesn't error, it just appears to
  "stop early" at `e_max * m_target/(m_beam+m_target)`. Caught this firsthand
  chasing a phantom ~7%-short cutoff that tracked the mass ratio exactly once
  compared side by side; there was no ceiling, just a lab-vs-c.m. mismatch in
  what was being compared to what.
- Always run **from the directory that contains the `.azr` file** (pyazr does
  this for you via `cwd=`, defaulting to the `.azr`'s directory), because the
  `.azr` stores `output/`, `checks/` and data paths *relative to itself*.
- The `output/` directory must exist; AZURE2 writes results there.
- **Delete `output/intEC.extrap` whenever the `<segmentsTest>` grid changes.**
  AZURE2 caches external-capture integrals there and silently reuses them on a
  different grid — this corrupts capture cross sections *and* data-mode χ²
  (integrals for data and test segments are built together at INITIALIZE).
  `intEC.dat` is the data-segment equivalent and is safe while `<segmentsData>`
  is untouched. Both are safe to delete; they just cost time to rebuild.
- **Several sessions can be open at once**, each an independent engine that
  enters its own directory per call — that is how `save_fit` verifies what it
  wrote. The engine is not *thread*-safe, so parallelism is one session per
  process, not per thread.
- CLI mode does **not** read Runtime Options from the `.azr` — pass them as
  flags every time (`--gsl-coul`, `--ignore-externals`, …). Note the Brune
  parameterization is **on by default** and there is no flag to turn it off;
  `--use-rmc` selects the mutually exclusive RMC formalism, and pyazr takes
  `use_brune=False` directly. **RMC is restricted to (n,γ) reactions** — the
  manual warns of unexpected errors if it is selected for anything else.
  **pyazr's own defaults can just as easily disagree with what a project's
  fits actually use** — `azure2()` defaults `use_long_wavelength=True`, but a
  project whose `run_crc_*` job scripts always pass `--no-long-wavelength`
  needs `use_long_wavelength=False` passed explicitly, or a pyazr session
  silently computes different physics than every CLI fit in that archive.
  Check the project's own job scripts for the flags actually in use — never
  assume pyazr's defaults match an established archive's CLI fits.
- **A pyazr session can silently rewrite a live fit's own output cache.**
  Opening `azure2(path, cwd=...)` against a `.azr` whose `<config>` output
  directory is a real, already-fitted `output/` recomputes and overwrites
  `intEC.dat`/`intEC.extrap` there if the runtime options (previous bullet) or
  segment count don't match what was cached — even for a read-only-looking
  calculation. On a 12C+alpha archive fit this overwrote a live baseline's
  `output/intEC.dat` with amplitudes for the wrong (`use_long_wavelength=True`)
  physics before the mistake was caught via a nonsensical χ² (~1e28). Point any
  exploratory pyazr session at a throwaway copy with its own output dir
  (`AzrModel.set_output_dir(...)`) instead of a fit's real `output/`; if it
  happens anyway, repair by rerunning a plain CLI calculate under the correct
  flags and confirming `chiSquared.out` reads back exactly as before.
- `--gsl-coul` is a real speed/accuracy tradeoff, not just a flag name: the
  default Coulomb-function method (Michel 2007) is more accurate but visibly
  slower than GSL's. Reach for `--gsl-coul` if a fit is too slow and the
  accuracy loss is acceptable, not by default.

## Workflow A — interactive CLI (one-shot runs)

Prompt order: **(1) menu choice → (2) external parameter file → (3) external
capture amplitude file → (4) mode-specific prompts**, then `7` to exit. Both
file prompts appear whether or not the model has capture, and a recipe that
feeds only one leaves the rest of the answers off by a line. Pipe stdin to run
non-interactively, and pass `--no-readline` so readline does not fight the
pipe. `tests/run_tests.sh` is the working reference.

| # | Mode |
|---|------|
| 1 | Calculate Segments From Data (`AZUREOut_*.out`, `chiSquared.out`) |
| 2 | Fit Segments From Data (Minuit2 → `param.sav`, `parameters.out`) |
| 3 | Calculate Segments Without Data / extrapolate (`AZUREOut_*.extrap`) |
| 4 | MINOS Error Analysis (`param.errors`, `covariance_matrix.out`) |
| 5 | Calculate Reaction Rate (needs temps → `reactionrates.dat`) |
| 6 | MCMC Bayesian Sampling (`samples.mcmc`) |
| 7 | Exit |

Mode 2's Minuit2 fit (MIGRAD) has a **hard-coded cap of 50,000 iterations** —
the run simply stops there regardless of whether it has actually converged.
On a large model (hundreds of free parameters), a flat-looking plateau near
iteration 50,000 is not proof of a true minimum; it may just be wherever the
fit happened to be sitting when the cap cut it off, and small stepwise
improvements (long flat stretches punctuated by discrete drops) can keep
recurring throughout the whole run, including near the very end. Don't infer
convergence from a plateau of a few hundred iterations — only trust an
explicit MIGRAD convergence message, or accept the iteration-50,000 result as
final-for-this-run while noting it may still improve with a further
warm-started refit.

Mode 5's numerical integration (GSL adaptive quadrature over the excitation
curve) is unreliable for narrow resonances — the manual advises caution below
a total width of ≈1 keV, where the integral may fail outright. In that regime,
sum the single-level narrow-resonance approximation instead of trusting the
numerical rate.

The **external parameter file** prompt: give a saved `output/param.sav` to start
from those best-fit formal parameters, or leave **blank** to build fresh from
the `.azr` levels.

```bash
# Calculate from the .azr's own parameters: menu, both file prompts blank, exit.
printf '1\n\n\n7\n' | AZURE2 --no-gui --no-readline 7Be.azr

# Calculate with saved best-fit params (parameter file given, EC file blank):
printf '1\noutput/param.sav\n\n7\n' | AZURE2 --no-gui --no-readline 7Be.azr

# Fit fresh from the .azr levels. Mode 2 then asks about the cross-section
# uncertainty band (y/n) and, if yes, reduced-chi2 scaling (y/n):
printf '2\n\n\nn\n7\n' | AZURE2 --no-gui --no-readline 7Be.azr

# Extrapolate (no data) using saved params:
printf '3\noutput/param.sav\n\nn\n7\n' | AZURE2 --no-gui --no-readline 7Be.azr
```

Non-interactive band control: `--covariance-band` (+ `--scale-covariance`) skips
the y/n prompts. Other flags: `--use-brune`, `--gsl-coul`, `--ignore-externals`,
`--use-rmc`, `--no-transform`; `--help` lists all.

## Workflow B — pyazr

pyazr embeds the AZURE2 engine in-process: the R-matrix code is compiled into
the pybind11 extension module `pyazr/_azure2`, and an `azure2()` object is a
real `AZUREAPI` session living in the interpreter. No subprocesses, no sockets,
no instance pool. A session is a context manager; always close it — that frees
the compound nucleus and data, which are several MB per model.

Install it from the repository root (it is not on PyPI):

```bash
pip install -e .                # core: numpy, mpmath, scipy
pip install -e ".[examples]"    # + matplotlib, emcee, multiprocess
pip install -e ".[all]"         # + zeus-mcmc
```

`-e` is the useful form, since the package lives in the checkout. The engine is
C++ and is **not** installed by pip — build the `_azure2` module with CMake
(`USE_API=ON`, the default), which lands it in `pyazr/`; a `pip install` ships
it as package data. `import pyazr` from the repository root picks up the built
module.

```python
import os
os.environ.setdefault("OMP_NUM_THREADS", "4")   # set BEFORE importing numpy
import numpy as np
from pyazr import azure2, AzrModel

with azure2("7Be.azr", cwd=HERE) as m:
    best = np.asarray(m.params_rwa, float)      # free parameter vector
    chi2 = np.sum(m.calculate_chi2_rwa(best))
```

Every `azure2()` object is an independent engine, and several can be open at
once — each enters its own directory per call, so they never disturb each other
or your cwd. The engine is *not* thread-safe, so parallelism is per process:
construct the session at module level of the worker module and every pool
worker gets its own, under either `spawn` or `fork`.

### Two parameter conventions

- **`*_rwa` methods** (`calculate_rwa`, `calculate_chi2_rwa`,
  `calculate_sfactor_rwa`, `chi2_and_grad`, `residual_jacobian`) take the
  **reduced-width-amplitude** vector `m.params_rwa`. This is the natural fit
  space and the only one with analytic derivatives. **Default to it.**
- **plain methods** (`calculate`, `calculate_chi2`) take the transformed
  **physical** vector `m.params` (level energies in MeV, partial widths in eV).
- `m.transform_rwa(x)` maps rwa → physical; it takes either the full free
  vector or just the leading R-matrix block (energies + widths), so the
  norm/shift tail can be sliced off:
  `nR = 1 + max(p.free_index for p in m.parameters if p.kind in ("energy","width") and not p.fixed and p.free_index is not None)`.

Both vectors hold only the **free** parameters, in `.azr` order:
`p.free_index` is the position in that vector, `p.index` the position among all
parameters (`m.fixed_params`, `param.sav` lines).

### Data mode vs extrapolation mode

`m.data_mode()` (default) evaluates the `<segmentsData>` segments — this is what
χ² uses. `m.extrap_mode()` switches to the `<segmentsTest>` grids. Both
re-INITIALIZE every instance, so switch sparingly and batch the work.

**Segment indexing** (a frequent source of silent misalignment):

- data mode: segment `i` ↔ `m.datasets[i]` (the i-th `<segmentsData>` line);
  `m.nsegments` and `len(m.energies[i])` are its point count.
- extrap mode: **only ACTIVE test segments are returned**, in file order, so
  segment `i` ↔ `m.extrapolations.active[i]` — not `m.extrapolations[i]`.
  (7Be: 113 test segments declared, 108 active and returned.)

### Inspecting a model

```python
print(m.level_scheme)          # pairs → J-groups → levels → channels (read-only)
print(m.parameters.table())    # idx, name, kind, free, J^pi, E, L, S, pair, rad, value, wigner
print(m.datasets.table())      # per data segment: file, reaction, observable, E range, norm err
print(m.extrapolations.table())
m.pairs                        # PairSet: masses, charges, spins, sep/excitation E, channel radius
m.parameters.free / .widths / .energies / .norms / .shifts
m.parameters.by_physical_level()   # {LevelKey: ParameterSet} — one entry per resonance/pole
m.physical_levels()                # the LevelKeys, ordered (jgroup, level)
m.datasets.sys_errors(vary_only=True)   # per-segment normalization systematics (fractional)
```

**`m.parameters` (and anything built on it — `.by_physical_level()`,
`without_level()`, `only_level()`, `find()`) can throw `RuntimeError:
parameter_info returned N parameters but params_fixed reported M`, preceded
by `**WARNING: Denominator less than zero while transforming` for one or more
levels.** This is a failure in pyazr's own parameter *introspection*
table-builder (`_build_parameters`), not in the calculation engine. It has
shown up on a model where `calculate_energies`/`calculate_rwa` (and the
CLI's own extrapolation mode, independently) ran the same levels through
cleanly and reproducibly with no warning at all — i.e. the core R-matrix
calculation was fine; only the human-readable parameter table choked on
those levels. Don't read this crash as evidence the fit or parameters are
corrupted on its own — cross-check with a plain `calculate_energies` call
(or the CLI) on the same file before concluding anything is actually wrong.

A `LevelKey` prints as `5/2-#2@6.588MeV`; `(jgroup, level)` is its identity
(AZURE2 restarts level numbering inside every J-group).

### χ², residuals, and AZURE2's objective

```python
chi2   = np.sum(m.calculate_chi2_rwa(x))    # total DATA chi-squared
val, g = m.chi2_and_grad(x)                 # analytic gradient (energies/widths/norms)
r, J   = m.residual_jacobian(x)             # r_i standardized: sum(r**2) == chi2

m.segment_chi2(x)      # one entry per <segmentsData> segment; sums to chi2
m.dataset_chi2(x)      # {name: (chi2, points, segments)} -- per experiment
m.penalties(x)         # {"norm": array, "shift": array}, per segment
m.objective(x)         # chi2 + penalties: what AZURE2's own fit minimizes
```

`residual_jacobian` costs ~2 forward evaluations for the whole Jacobian
(reverse-mode adjoint) — that is what makes a Gauss-Newton / LM fit in Python
cheaper than Minuit's numerical gradients. Energy-shift columns come back zero;
an analytically unsupported segment raises.

**Fit against `objective`, not `calculate_chi2_rwa`.** The latter is the *data*
χ² only. `AZURECalc::operator()` also adds, per segment,
`((norm − nominal)/(nominal/100 · norm_error))²` and, for a free energy shift,
`((shift − nominal)/shift_error)²`. Minimize the bare χ² and the normalizations
drift to absorb every discrepancy — a "better" number AZURE2 would never have
found (−480 on the 7Be model). Note the denominator uses the **nominal**
normalization, and that `norm_error` is a **percentage**.

`m.objective(x)` is exactly what `chiSquared.out` reports as
`Total-Chi-Squared` + `Total-Norm-Chi-Squared`; `tests/pyazr/objective_test.py`
cross-checks it against the engine rather than against the formula.

For a least-squares fit that needs the penalties as residual *rows* (so LM sees
their Jacobian), append them with their constant derivatives:

```python
pen = [(p.free_index, d.norm, d.norm / 100.0 * d.norm_error)
       for p in m.parameters.norms
       for d in [m.datasets.by_key(p.segment_key)] if d.norm_error > 0]
Jpen = np.zeros((len(pen), nfree))
for k, (fi, _, s) in enumerate(pen): Jpen[k, fi] = 1.0 / s
resid = np.concatenate([r, [(z[fi] - n0) / s for fi, n0, s in pen]])
```

### Writing the run's output files

```python
m.write_output_files()        # AZUREOut_*, chiSquared.out, into output/
m.write_output_files(x_best)  # at a particular parameter vector
```

The files a colleague or the GUI's plot tab expects, without re-running the
binary. `output/` must already exist. In data mode this runs the χ²
evaluation first — `chiSquared.out` reports the per-segment χ² *stored on each
segment*, and only that evaluation sets it, so writing after a bare forward
pass gives a well-formed file full of zeros.

`param.par` and `parameters.out` do not come from this call: the first is
written at initialization, the second by `CNuc::PrintTransformParams` at the
end of a CLI run. Use `m.transform_rwa(x)` for the numbers `parameters.out`
would carry.

### Free-vector helpers

`Parameter.free_index` is a parameter's position in the free vector; threading
that by hand is the usual source of silent misalignment.

```python
m.n_rmatrix                       # where the R-matrix block ends: x[:m.n_rmatrix]
w = m.parameters.widths
w.indices()                       # their free-vector positions
w.take(x)                         # their entries of x
w.put(x, 0.0)                     # a copy of x with every width zeroed
m.datasets.by_key(p.segment_key)  # the segment a norm/shift belongs to
```

`by_key` rather than `datasets[key - 1]`: a segment key counts the *inactive*
segments too, so it is not an index.

### Calculating observables

```python
m.calculate_rwa(x)                  # cross section per segment (b or b/sr)
m.calculate_sfactor_rwa(x)          # S-factor per segment (MeV b)
m.calculate_energies(x)             # c.m. energies of the calculated points
m.calculate_excitation_energy(x)    # compound-nucleus Ex — the common axis across channels
m.calculate_angles(x)               # c.m. angles (differ from the lab angles in the .azr)
m.calculate_analyzing_power_rwa(x)  # vector A_y, for analyzing-power segments
m.calculate_angular_dists_rwa(x)    # Legendre coefficients, for ang-dist segments
```

Plot different reaction channels against **excitation energy**; it is the only
axis shared by all entrance pairs. `E_cm = Ex − threshold`.

### Analyzing power (observable 7)

The vector analyzing power `A_y` for a spin-1/2 projectile. Declare a segment
with `observable="analyzing-power"` (code 7 in the raw `.azr`); it is reported
**in place of** the cross section, so χ², fitting, plotting and output files
need no special handling.

```python
ay = m.calculate_analyzing_power_rwa(m.params_rwa)
```

Works for a spin-1/2 **projectile** on a target of any spin, in **both particle
and capture** exit channels — by two different routes.

*Particle exits* use Seyler's channel-spin amplitude matrix. The amplitudes come
out of the R-matrix in the channel-spin basis, so for a target with spin the
entrance index is decomposed into projectile and target projections before
`sigma_y` is applied to the projectile alone. For a spin-0 target (¹²C) the
channel spin *is* the projectile's and no decomposition is needed; for a
spin-1/2 target (¹⁵N) the channel spins are 0 and 1 and never 1/2.

*Capture exits* have no such amplitude matrix and use the Legendre coefficients
of Seyler & Weller, PRC 20 (1979) 453, Eqs. (20) and (21):
`A_y = sum_k b_k P_k^1(cos t) / sum_k a_k P_k(cos t)`, built by
`CNuc::CalcCaptureAnalyzingPower` (lazily, on first use — the 9-j symbols cost
time) and evaluated by `GenMatrixFunc::CalculateCaptureAnalyzingPower`. External
capture is included; a term may pair two internal pathways, two external ones or
one of each. The analytic adjoint is in `AMatrixFunc::PointAdjoint`.

The reason capture needs its own pathway table: `a_k` forces `s = s'`, so
`CalcAngularDists` only ever pairs pathways inside one KGroup. `b_k` does not,
and those channel-spin off-diagonal terms are exactly what the polarization
observable adds. `AZURE2_CAPPOL_DEBUG=1` prints, per point, the check that
`sum_k a_k P_k` reproduces AZURE2's own differential capture cross section, up
to `400*pi/(geom*I1I2)` — it agrees to machine precision. Reference case and the
validation against the paper's worked example: `tests/13N_capture_ay`.

Four things that will bite:

- **Angles are centre-of-mass** in the data file, unlike an ordinary
  differential segment. Columns are `E_lab · theta_cm · A_y · dA_y`.
- **A_y is a dimensionless ratio in [-1,1] and is often negative.** Take the
  point-to-point uncertainties from the experimenters — for `A_y` these are
  statistical and background-subtraction errors and are quoted as *absolute*
  values, not percentages. Do not convert them to a relative error: a point
  near a zero crossing does not thereby have a small uncertainty, and treating
  it as though it does gives those points enormous weight and wrecks the fit.
- **Do use a normalization, and free it.** The dominant systematic in an
  analyzing-power measurement is the absolute calibration of the beam
  polarization, and it scales `A_y` multiplicatively — the experiment reports
  `A_y ∝ (N⁺−N⁻)/(P·(N⁺+N⁻))`, so an error in `P` is a scale error on `A_y`.
  That is exactly a normalization, and it is meaningful however small `A_y`
  is. AZURE2 already treats it correctly: an analyzing-power point stores
  `A_y` in the cross-section slot, and the χ² compares the calculated value
  against `data × norm`, so `set_segment_norm(name, vary=True,
  sys_error=<beam-polarization uncertainty in %>)` does the right thing.
  (Earlier guidance here said to leave `vary_norm` off on the grounds that a
  normalization is meaningless for a ratio. That was wrong — the ratio is of
  yields at fixed `P`, not of quantities that both scale with it.)
- **Use segments with no target integration** when comparing against
  thin-target data. `A_y` averaged over a target is cross-section weighted,
  `<A_y> = ∫A_y σ dE / ∫σ dE`, and since Rutherford σ diverges at low energy
  where A_y ≈ 0, a thick target drives the average to ~1e-6. That is physics,
  not a bug.

Analytic derivatives cover A_y in both channels, *except* for a point that also
carries target integration — that one reports itself unsupported, which drops
the analytic Jacobian for the whole fit back to numerical. Never wrong, just
slower. For capture there is a second reason to avoid target integration: the
geometric attenuation coefficients AZURE2 folds into `P_k` have no counterpart
for the `P_k^1` of the numerator.

Worked comparison against measured data: `tests/13N`, segments 11–16 (Baumann
1992). Capture: `tests/13N_capture_ay`. Formalism and implementation:
`docs/source/theory/polarization_*.rst`.

## Editing the model: adding and removing levels

AZURE2 reads its model from the file, so an edited scheme is applied by
**writing a new `.azr` and launching a fresh instance from it**. `AzrModel`
parses only the `<levels>` block and re-emits everything else verbatim; the
original file is never modified.

```python
from pyazr import AzrModel, azure2

mdl = AzrModel.from_file("7Be.azr")
print(mdl)                                        # J^pi / energies / channels / fixed flags
mdl.find(jpi="5/2+", energy=10.253, tol=2e-2)     # -> [AzrLevel]

mdl.remove_level(jpi="1/2+", energy=20)           # drop a background pole entirely
mdl.add_level(J=1.5, parity=+1, energy=8.6,       # add a 3/2+ resonance
              channels=[dict(pair=1, L=2, S=0.5, gamma=1000.0, fixed=False),
                        dict(pair=2, L=1, S=0.5, gamma=0.1)],
              level_fixed=False)                  # level_fixed=False -> energy is a fit parameter
mdl.deactivate_level(jpi="7/2-", energy=4.572)    # keep in file, zero+fix every gamma
path = mdl.write("_test.azr")

with azure2(path, cwd=HERE) as m:
    ...
```

Rules that will bite you:

- **All levels of one J^π share one channel set** (an R-matrix J-group
  requirement). If a level of that `(J, parity)` already exists, `add_level`
  clones that group's exact channel structure and applies your `gamma`/`fixed`
  only to matching `(pair, L, S)`; unmentioned channels are added inert
  (`gamma=0`, fixed). A spec matching none of them raises and lists the allowed
  channels. Only for a brand-new J^π do your channels define the group.
- For the same reason `remove_channel(jpi, pair, L, S)` removes that channel
  from **every level of the group**; removing it from one level makes AZURE2
  reject the file.
- `add_level`/`add_channel` can only reference a **pair that already exists**
  in the file — new particle pairs must be added in the GUI.
- `gamma` in the file is the **reduced width / ANC input**, not the eV partial
  width the GUI shows. Seed a new channel with a small nonzero value (fits from
  exactly 0 have zero gradient) and set `fixed=False` to free it.
- Levels are renumbered (`levelID`) automatically on every edit.

**Removing a level: file-level vs runtime.** Two different tools:

| | effect | use for |
|---|---|---|
| `AzrModel.remove_level` | level gone from the file; parameter vector shrinks | a persisted reduced model to refit |
| `AzrModel.deactivate_level` | stays in the file, all γ = 0 and fixed | persisted "level off" that keeps the J-group's channel set |
| `azure2.without_level(x, ...)` | returns a copy of `x` with that level's free reduced widths zeroed | *frozen* Δχ² probes, no refit, same parameter vector |
| `azure2.only_level(x, ...)` | zeroes every *other* level's widths | the bare contribution of one resonance |

Zeroing reduced widths decouples a level from every channel, so it contributes
exactly nothing — provided its *fixed* widths are already zero (check with
`m.parameters.widths`; in the 7Be model all fixed widths are 0).

Other `.azr` edits without touching the GUI:

```python
mdl.channel_radii()                                      # {pair: radius fm}
mdl.set_channel_radius(1, 5.0)                           # 3He+alpha, all its lines
mdl.set_segment_norm("Toth", vary=True, sys_error=8.0)   # percent, as stored
mdl.set_segment_active("Spiger", False)                  # drop a dataset from the fit
mdl.set_segment_datafile("Elwyn-F0012002", "data/new.dat")
mdl.add_data_segment("data/roughton.dat", entrance=1, exit=2,
                     observable="total-capture", energy_min=0.3,
                     energy_max=2.3, norm_error=5.0)     # brand-new dataset
mdl.remove_data_segments("artemov.dat")                  # or clear_data_segments()
mdl.set_extrapolations([...]) / add_extrapolation(...) / clear_extrapolations()
m.save_fit("fitted.azr", x_best)   # fit -> a .azr + its param.sav, verified
```

`observable="total-capture"` (Angle Integrated Total Capture) needs every
significant γ-cascade transition set up as its own `(Particle, Gamma)`
particle pair beforehand — AZURE2 sums over them automatically for a segment
declared with this observable. It is the user's responsibility to have
included all the important transitions; there is nothing to sum by hand.

`add_data_segment` observables include `analyzing-power` (code 7), and
`pyazr/examples/exfor_fetch.py` + the `nds-explorer` skill show how to fetch
real datasets from EXFOR/NDS and feed them into `add_data_segment`.

**Never fit a derived/extrapolated point alongside the data it was derived
from.** EXFOR sometimes carries a paper's own R-matrix or polynomial
extrapolation as a separate subentry — most often a zero-energy
astrophysical S-factor, S(0). Fitting AZURE2 to it is circular: the fit
gets constrained against a number some other model already derived from
data that is very likely already in the same fit. The subentry label is
the tell — "S-factor point" (or "SFC") on a lone point, or a handful of
points, sitting well outside the energy range of that paper's real
measurements is model output, not data. Two found and removed from the
same 12C+p archive fit: `Kettner2023_S0point_pg.dat` (one point at 25 keV,
EXFOR C2972006, "S-factor point" — the paper's actual measurements start
above 1 MeV) and `Vogl1963_S0point_pg.dat` (EXFOR C1672006, same pattern,
sitting next to the legitimate 80-point `Vogl1963_pg.dat` from the same
paper). Check EXFOR provenance notes for this pattern before activating a
new single- or few-point segment, not just after.

**Adding/removing data segments invalidates the EC integral cache.** After any
`add_data_segment` / `remove_data_segments` / `clear_data_segments` /
`set_extrapolations` edit, delete `output/intEC.dat` and `output/intEC.extrap`
before the next run, or give the edited model its own output dir
(`mdl.set_output_dir(...)`); otherwise AZURE2 silently reuses integrals
computed for the *old* grids. In a live session,
`azr.recalculate_external_capture()` forces a recompute. See
`pyazr/examples/edit_model.py`.

**Removing (or inserting) a `<segmentsData>` row breaks any external
`param.sav` built against the old numbering — silently.** A segment's
norm/shift Minuit parameter is named `segment_<key>_norm` /
`segment_<key>_energy_shift`, where `<key>` is its 1-based position counting
*every* line, active or not (`Segment.key`, matching `Parameter.segment_key`).
Deleting an earlier row shifts every later key down by one, but
`AZUREParams::ReadUserParameters` matches an external parameter file purely by
exact name string — across *all* parameters, fixed or free — and calls
`SetValue()` unconditionally on any match, with no warning on a stale one. Two
distinct ways this has actually bitten a 12C+alpha archive fit: (1) a remap
script that renamed `segment_N_norm` for every `N` past the cut but forgot
`segment_N_energy_shift` needs the identical treatment (both are keyed by the
same per-segment number, `EData::FillMnParams`), silently reapplying one
segment's stale fixed energy-shift calibration to its unrelated neighbour; (2)
a *second* remap script whose regex anchored at the start of the line failed to
match `segment_N_norm` specifically, because those lines are indented in
`param.sav` while `segment_N_energy_shift` lines are not — leaving every
normalization at its old, pre-removal numbering while shifts were correctly
remapped. Both loaded and fit without any error message. When editing
`<segmentsData>` and reusing an old `param.sav`: remap **every** per-segment
parameter family by the same shifted key, not just the one you're thinking
about, and verify the remap directly (diff the boundary rows on both sides of
the edit) rather than trusting that it worked.

**`m.save_fit(path, x=None)` is how you snapshot a fit.** It writes the `.azr`,
writes the companion `param.sav`, and verifies the result — reopening what it
wrote and comparing every R-matrix value against the fit. If they disagree it
removes both files and raises, so a snapshot you still have is one that reads
back as the fit it came from. `path` is always explicit; nothing is written in
place. Returns `(azr_path, sav_path)`.

```python
azr, sav = m.save_fit("7Be_fit.azr")          # current parameters
azr, sav = m.save_fit("7Be_fit.azr", x_best)  # or an explicit free vector
```

Three things it handles that used to be the caller's problem:

**The `<levels>` `gamma` field is NOT a reduced-width amplitude.** It holds the
physical value `parameters.out` prints: Γ in **eV** for an open particle
channel, an **ANC in fm^-1/2** for a closed (sub-threshold) one, Γ_γ in eV for a
photon channel — i.e. exactly `transform_rwa(x)`. In the 7Be model the two
differ by factors of 10² to 10⁷, and a file written with the rwa loads without
complaint and is wrong.

**A `Parameter`'s `pair` is not the file's pair key.** It is the *engine's*
number, which counts particle pairs in the order `<levels>` first mentions them.
On the 8Be model engine pair 1 is file key 2 and file key 1 is engine pair 6 —
match one against the other and every width lands on the wrong channel. Calling
`AzrModel.apply_fit` directly? Pass `pairs=m.pairs`, or it cannot translate.

**Normalizations and energy shifts are not in `<levels>`.** A calculate run on a
bare `.azr` uses 1.0 for every dataset, so its χ² sits *above* the fit's by
whatever they were absorbing (3He: 166 fitted, 769 from the snapshot). That is
what the companion `param.sav` carries — hand it to AZURE2 as the external
parameter file and the model is whole.

`AzrModel.apply_fit` is the lower-level half if you need it: it takes
`pairs=`, matches levels on the engine's own `(jgroup, level)` via
`engine_level_keys()`, and refuses (rather than silently skipping) any parameter
it cannot place. It does not verify — `save_fit` does that.

`pyazr/examples/save_fit_to_azr.py` does the whole thing — loads a fit from
`param.sav` or an `.npz`, optionally re-radiuses it (`--radius 1=4.70`, dropping
the stale `intEC` caches), writes the `.azr` plus a companion `param.sav` with
the norms, and fails loudly if the result does not round-trip.

### What a snapshot still cannot carry

`save_fit` verifies the `.azr` it writes, so a mismatched snapshot no longer
reaches you silently — it raises and removes the file. Two things remain true
of the `.azr` itself:

- **Normalizations do not live in `<levels>`.** A calculate run on a snapshot
  uses 1.0 for every dataset, so its `chiSquared.out` sits *above* the fit's by
  whatever the normalizations were absorbing — 3He: 166 fitted, 769 from the
  snapshot. Write them alongside (`output/normalizations.out`) or supply a
  `param.sav`.
- **The check dumps are keywords, not filenames.** `<config>` accepts only
  `none`, `screen` or `file` (`Config::ReadConfigFile`); anything else silently
  leaves the check off and `checks/` stays empty. Write `file`.
- **Inactive `<levels>` lines used to corrupt every bake of their J-group
  (fixed 2026-09-05).** The engine skips `isActive=0` lines (`CNuc::Fill`),
  so an inactive level neither opens a J-group nor takes a level number;
  `AzrModel.engine_level_keys()` counted them anyway, and `apply_fit`/`save_fit`
  wrote every later level of that group one line too early. On the 13C+α
  archive fit this silently deleted a fitted 5/2+ level and parked two others
  on inactive lines at two successive bakes — and `save_fit`'s own verify
  passed, because it compares the reopened file's *transformed parameters*
  against the fit, both of which count the same (wrong) lines. Now
  `engine_level_keys` skips inactive levels, `AzrLevel.active`/`set_active`
  read and set the flag, and `AzrModel.purge_inactive_levels()` removes such
  lines for good; regression test `tests/pyazr/inactive_lines_test.py`.
  **Verify a bake with a *blank* external parameter file**, not with
  `param.sav`: mode 1 with an external file loads that file's values by
  parameter name and overrides `<levels>` entirely, so it can only ever
  confirm the `.sav`, never the `<levels>` block. A blank-file run must equal
  a pyazr evaluation at the fitted R-matrix block with every norm/shift at
  its nominal value (the `.sav` carries the norms; `<levels>` cannot).
- **`m.datasets[i]` is not segment `i` of a result on a model with inactive
  segments (fixed 2026-09-05).** `penalties()`/`objective()` and
  `dataset_chi2()` indexed it that way, dropping the normalization penalty of
  every active segment past the active count and mislabeling datasets. Use
  `m.active_datasets` (one entry per engine segment, in result order) — that
  is what the fixed methods do.
- **The internal verify (`rtol=1e-4`) is far looser than the engine's own
  round-trip noise, and can still hide real fragility.** AZURE2's rwa↔physical
  conversion for an open channel is not perfectly bit-reproducible between
  sessions — typically 1e-7 to 1e-6 relative, nowhere near `save_fit`'s
  tolerance. For a well-conditioned model that is irrelevant. For one sitting
  near a destructive-interference minimum (a broad, high-lying background pole
  feeding a low-energy capture channel, say) that tiny noise floor can move
  specific datasets' χ² by two or three orders of magnitude even though
  `save_fit` verifies cleanly — on a 12C+alpha archive fit, a ~5e-7 relative
  change to one 887 keV-wide background level's widths turned one segment's χ²
  of 883 into 358,000. A passing `save_fit` verify is not proof that reopening
  the snapshot reproduces the fit's χ² — check the total (or per-segment, via
  `m.segment_chi2`) objective too, especially before trusting a freshly-baked
  file as a refit's starting point.

### Defining extrapolation grids

```python
mdl.set_extrapolations([
    dict(entrance=1, exit=-1, e_min=0.10/cm2lab, e_max=8.5/cm2lab,
         e_step=0.05/cm2lab, observable="total-capture"),
    dict(entrance=1, exit=1, e_min=0.05, e_max=6.0, e_step=0.05,
         observable="differential-cm", angle=90.0),
])
```

`exit=-1` means summed/total (capture). `observable` ∈ `angle-integrated`,
`differential`, `differential-cm`, `total-capture`, `angular-distribution`
(needs `order=`), `phase-shift` (needs `phase_J=`, `phase_L=`). Energies are
**lab** (`cm2lab = m_target/(m_beam+m_target)`; ³He+α 0.5703, p+⁶Li 0.8565 —
divide c.m. by it). Remember to delete `output/intEC.extrap` afterwards.

Note the `isDiff` codes differ between the two blocks: in `<segmentsData>` 3 is
total-capture and 4 is differential-cm; in `<segmentsTest>` 3 is angular
distribution, 4 total-capture, 5 differential-cm. pyazr handles this — hand-edits
must not.

## Fitting from Python

**pyazr does not fit.** It gives you the model, the χ², the objective and an
analytic Jacobian; the minimizer is yours. That is deliberate rather than a
gap: `residual_jacobian` returns the whole Jacobian for ~2 forward evaluations
(reverse-mode adjoint), which beats Minuit's numerical gradients on this
problem, and binding `MnMigrad`/`MnMinos` would mean mirroring AZURE2's
objective, parameter limits and Wigner bounds inside the API — two "AZURE2
fits" that can silently disagree. The CLI (modes 2 and 4) remains the reference
implementation.

Two things a hand-rolled fit must do to match AZURE2:

- **Minimize `m.objective(x)`**, not `calculate_chi2_rwa` — see the χ² section
  above. Bare χ² lets the normalizations absorb everything.
- **Respect the Wigner limits** if you care about them; `m.wigner_widths()`
  gives the bound per channel. The engine's `ParameterLimitsManager` enforces
  them, a Python fit will not unless you add them as bounds.

`scipy.optimize.least_squares` with the analytic Jacobian, fitting a **subset**
at frozen everything-else — the usual evaluation move:

```python
from scipy.optimize import least_squares

fit = np.array([p.free_index for p in m.parameters.widths
                if not p.fixed and p.radiation_type in ("E", "M")], int)

def resid(z):
    v = np.array(best, float); v[fit] = z
    return m.residual_jacobian(v)[0]

def jac(z):
    v = np.array(best, float); v[fit] = z
    return np.asarray(m.residual_jacobian(v)[1])[:, fit]

sol = least_squares(resid, best[fit], jac=jac, method="lm",
                    xtol=1e-14, ftol=1e-14, max_nfev=2000)
x = np.array(best, float); x[fit] = sol.x
```

For asymmetric (MINOS-style) errors, point `iminuit` at `m.objective` and
`m.chi2_and_grad` — it gives you `minos()` against the same objective the CLI
uses, without a second implementation of it inside AZURE2.

Fit in **rwa space** (that is where the Jacobian is exact) and convert for
reporting with `transform_rwa`. Free the relevant normalizations too
(`m.parameters.norms`; `m.datasets.by_key(p.segment_key)` is the segment) when
a subset fit would otherwise be absorbed by them.

Sanity-check the fit space: `transform_rwa(best[:nR])[p.free_index]` must equal
`p.value` for every width.

Save the result with `m.save_fit("fitted.azr", x)` — see the editing section.

For MCMC, `pyazr/examples/fit_emcee.py` and `fit_zeus.py` show the pattern —
one in-process engine per pool worker (constructed at module level), priors
chosen per `p.kind`, and
`log_prob = -0.5*(chi2 + offset) + log_prior` with
`offset = Σ log(2π σ²)`.

### Three traps that cost a whole evaluation

Found while building a BBN/pp-chain campaign; each produced a wrong answer
*silently*. The `evaluations/_tools/...` files cited below live in that analysis
repository, not in this one — the descriptions stand without them.

#### 1. `intEC.extrap` must be deleted before every extrapolation run

The golden rule above says to delete it "whenever the `<segmentsTest>` grid
changes". **That is not sufficient.** A session that initialises in data mode
and then calls `extrap_mode()` reuses whatever `intEC.extrap` is on disk, and
those amplitudes do not match the combined data+test integration set the second
INITIALIZE builds. Three identical runs of the same 7Be analysis script:

| run | caches | S₃₄(10 keV) | S(p,γ)(10 keV) | S(p,α)(10 keV) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | deleted | 0.5402 keV b | 0.0912 keV b | 3254 keV b |
| 2 | deleted | 0.5402 keV b | 0.0912 keV b | 3254 keV b |
| 3 | reused | **1.055** keV b | **2.4e8** keV b | 3254 keV b |

The particle-exit grid is identical in all three — that is the signature, since
only capture reads these integrals. Rebuilding costs seconds. Put the deletion
in the script, not in your memory:

```python
for f in ("intEC.dat", "intEC.extrap"):
    p = os.path.join(eval_dir, "output", f)
    if os.path.exists(p): os.remove(p)
```

(`evaluations/_tools/uq.py:clear_ec_cache`.)

#### 2. A zero Jacobian column freezes `scipy.least_squares`

`residual_jacobian` returns an identically zero column for any parameter no
active dataset can see — a γ width in a model with no capture data, a channel
of a level that nothing populates. With `x_scale="jac"` that column's scale is
zero, and TRF reports convergence after **one** function evaluation while the
gradient at other parameters is still in the hundreds. On the 8Be model this
froze every normalization at exactly 1.0 for the entire run and left
χ²/N = 5.6; dropping the dead columns first gave χ²/N = 1.01 from the same
seeds.

```python
J = fitter.jacobian(x0)[:, cols]
cols = cols[np.max(np.abs(J), axis=0) > 0]      # before least_squares
```

A norm penalty of *exactly* 0.0 alongside free normalizations is the tell:
`m.penalties(x)["norm"].sum()` says so directly.

#### 3. `residual_jacobian` raises, and the exception aborts the fit

A trust-region step can put a reduced width where the Coulomb functions
overflow (`RuntimeError: z is not finite in log_Gamma`) or where the level
matrix is singular. Catch it and return a large residual with a zero Jacobian:
the optimiser then shrinks the region, which is what it would have concluded
from a finite but terrible χ². Letting it propagate loses the whole fit.

### Fitting a model built from hand-chosen seeds

A fresh `.azr` is far from any minimum and a single global fit over sixty
parameters walks into a bad one. Free the parameters in the order the data
constrain them, warm-starting each stage, and run the sequence two or three
times:

1. the particle widths of the pair that carries the dominant reaction;
2. the other particle pairs;
3. the γ widths, at fixed particle widths;
4. the background poles;
5. everything, including level energies and normalizations.

`evaluations/_tools/fitting.py` (`Fitter.stages`) implements this with the
penalty rows, the dead-column filter and the exception guard already in place.

#### Fits with interfering channels can get stuck on the wrong branch

This is general to any R-matrix fit with more than one amplitude feeding the
same final channel — background poles interfering with a real resonance,
two resonances of the same J^π, internal vs. external capture, several
background poles against each other — in any channel type, particle or γ.
Interference is not a convex function of the interfering amplitudes' signs
and relative magnitudes, so there can be more than one distinct,
well-separated local minimum ("branch"), each a genuinely different
combination of constructive/destructive interference. A least-squares fit
(LM/TRF) starting every free amplitude from a small, same-sign seed can
only walk downhill toward the *nearest* branch. If a better branch needs a
much larger magnitude and/or a sign flip, reaching it means crossing
through *worse* χ² first — which gradient descent will not do, and which a
revert-on-out-of-bound guard (built to catch genuine numerical runaway)
cannot tell apart from real progress: it just sees a parameter heading
somewhere large and stops it.

The tell: if independent fit attempts — different seeds, different subsets
of parameters freed, different guard bounds — keep reverting with the
*same* parameter(s) pushing toward the *same* large value, that recurrence
is itself diagnostic. It is not noise to suppress with a tighter bound; it
is the optimizer repeatedly trying to point at where the other branch is.

The fix is not a better guard, it is a better starting point: hand-seed the
interfering amplitudes at a large-magnitude, sign-varied point (from a
previous fit of the same or a similar reaction, or by trying several
sign/magnitude combinations) and let the fit *descend* into that branch
rather than climb into it from near zero. Worked example (background γ
channels, but the mechanism is identical for particle widths or any other
interfering amplitude): a 12C(p,γ) fit repeatedly reverted trying to push
two background γ widths to ~4–7×10⁵ eV across three independent attempts
(different channel subsets, different seeds); recalculating — no fitting
yet — from a hand-picked starting point with those same channels at
~200–1300 eV and one sign flipped immediately dropped one
previously-terrible data segment's χ²/N from 79.8 to 17.2.

Practical guidance: when standing up any set of interfering amplitudes for
a new reaction (background poles, near-degenerate resonances, internal vs.
external capture), do not assume the small-positive-seed branch is the only
or the best one — if a prior fit of the same or a similar reaction exists,
seed from its converged values (signs included) rather than from scratch.

Follow-up, same fit, confirming the guard-vs-runaway distinction: after
reaching the better branch above, one background E2 channel (width_6_3)
still reverted against a generous but finite Weisskopf-unit guard
(CAP_WU=50). The tell that this was not another runaway: the optimizer's
own termination was `gtol` (it converged, in that direction, to
66.7–83.6 W.u.) rather than exhausting `max_nfev` or pinning at some huge
multiple of the guard the way every earlier true runaway in this same
exercise had (hundreds to hundreds of thousands of W.u.). Raising the guard
50 → 100 W.u. and re-running produced zero reverts anywhere in the fit; the
channel settled at 77.2 W.u. — exactly inside the range the reverted run
had already pointed at — with only a small further χ² improvement on top.
Practical guidance, refined: when a fit reverts at a guard boundary, check
*how* it reverted before assuming instability. A `gtol`/`xtol`/`ftol`
termination — the optimizer actually converged, and the guard is what
flagged it afterward — is evidence of a real local minimum just past the
current bound, not a runaway; `max_nfev` exhaustion or a value sitting at
many multiples of the guard is the actual runaway signature. Raising the
guard is a legitimate modeling decision in the first case (how large a W.u.
value is still physically reasonable for a background pole) and not a
tuning job to bypass a fit that hasn't actually converged in the second.

## Decomposing a cross section

Everything below is done at the **fitted point, without refitting**, so each
number is that component's raw contribution.

```python
m.extrap_mode()
ex   = m.calculate_excitation_energy(best)     # common Ex axis
full = m.calculate_rwa(best)
off  = m.calculate_rwa(m.without_level(best, jpi="5/2-", energy=6.588))
only = m.calculate_rwa(m.only_level(best,    jpi="5/2-", energy=6.588))
bg   = m.calculate_rwa(zero_all_widths(best))  # non-resonant / hard-sphere / external
interference = (full - off) - (only - bg)
```

- `full − off` = everything the level does (resonant + its interference).
- `only − bg` = the bare resonance on the non-resonant background.
- The difference is pure interference. It is **block-diagonal in J^π** — only
  same-J^π levels interfere; that is a correctness check on any decomposition.
- Pairwise, level T against level L:
  `cross = only{T,L} − only{T} − only{L} + bg = 2 Re(A_T A_L*)`. Integrate
  `|cross|` over Ex to rank which partners a level interferes with.

**Capture-specific.** Zeroing only the **γ-channel** widths
(`p.radiation_type in ("E","M")`) leaves every particle channel — and therefore
the whole scattering solution — untouched, so it decomposes the capture
amplitude cleanly. Zero *all* γ widths at once and what remains is the
**external (direct) capture**.

**S-factor.** `calculate_sfactor_rwa` = cross section × an energy-only
conversion factor, so linear combinations of cross sections may be converted
after the fact: `conv = sfactor_full / xs_full` (guard the zeros) and multiply
each curve by it. Units: MeV b — ×10³ for keV b, ×10⁶ for eV b.

## Evaluation recipes

**Is a level needed?** Frozen Δχ² ranking — recompute χ² with each level in turn
switched off (`without_level`) at fixed parameters. Then, for the candidates,
refit with the level removed (`AzrModel.remove_level` / `deactivate_level` +
`least_squares`) — the frozen Δχ² is an upper bound on the level's importance,
the refit Δχ² is the honest one. Report both, plus which experiments' χ² move
(per-dataset partition above): a level justified by one dataset is a different
claim from one justified by all of them.

**Changing the channel radius.** `m.set_channel_radius(pair, r)` on a live
instance, or `AzrModel.set_channel_radius(pair, r)` + `write()` to persist one.
The radius is the matching surface, so AZURE2 rebuilds the compound nucleus and
data, redoes penetrabilities / shift functions / boundary conditions / Wigner
limits, and recomputes **every external-capture integral** (the API clears
`USE_PREVIOUS_INTEGRALS` for the rebuild, so `output/intEC*` is not reused).
A reduced width means something different at a different radius — **the model is
no longer fitted, so refit before reading anything off it.** For a scan, give
each radius its own directory (own `output/`, `data` symlinked) and walk the
ladder outward, warm-starting each radius from its converged neighbour rather
than from the original fit; starting them all from one point biases the ends.

**Is a new level/channel warranted?** Add it (`add_level`, or free one more
channel of an existing level), refit the subset it can affect, and weigh Δχ²
against the parameters spent and against physical bounds: θ² ≤ 1 for particle
channels, a few W.u. for γ channels. Sweep candidates in a loop; several sessions may be open at once.

**Dimensionless widths.** `m.dimensionless_widths(x)` (pyazr ≥ 2.4) does the
whole job — θ² for every particle channel, W.u. for every γ channel, at any
parameter vector:

```python
t = m.dimensionless_widths(best)          # -> WidthTable of ChannelWidth rows
print(t.photons.nonzero.table())          # .particles / .photons / .free / .nonzero
[c for c in t.particles if c.theta2 and c.theta2 > 1]
```

Each row carries `theta2` (= Γ/Γ_W), `theta2_formal` (= γ²/γ²_W),
`wigner_width` (Γ_W, eV), `wigner_gamma2` (γ²_W, MeV), and for photons
`e_gamma`, `weisskopf`, `wu`. Closed (sub-threshold) channels have `is_open =
False`, no Γ_W — AZURE2 reports an ANC there, not a width. `m.wigner_widths(x)`
returns just `{free_index: Γ_W}`; `weisskopf_width(rad, L, E_γ, A)` and
`m.mass_number` are exposed separately. Example:
`pyazr/examples/dimensionless_widths.py <azr> [--params output/param.sav]`.

The reason there are two answers: AZURE2 exposes the Wigner limit in two
non-interchangeable forms.

1. **GUI / width form**, in eV next to each channel: `Γ_W = 2 P_l(E_r) γ²_W`,
   energy-dependent. **θ² = Γ/Γ_W** — prefer this; it is checkable one channel
   at a time in the GUI.
2. **API form**, `Parameter.wigner_limit`: `γ²_W = ħ²/(μ a²)` in **MeV**,
   already squared and energy-independent. Then θ² = γ²_formal/γ²_W with the
   formal reduced width (`g_int` in `parameters.out`, squared).

Never divide by `wigner_limit` twice. The two differ by the level-shift factor
`1/(1 + Σ_c γ_c² dS_c/dE)`, negligible for narrow levels but a factor 70+ for
the 30 MeV background poles. AZURE2 reports **observed** partial widths,
`Γ_c = 2 P_c γ_c²/(1 + Σ γ² dS/dE)`. Some references use the Teichmann–Wigner
sum-rule unit `3ħ²/(2μa²)`, 1.5× larger (`teichmann_wigner()`).

`Γ_W` needs `P_l(E_r)`, which the API does not expose; `wigner_widths` gets it
out of AZURE2 itself by transforming a probe vector with every rwa set to a tiny
`eps`, so the shift denominator is 1 and `Γ_c(eps) = 2 P_c eps²`. One extra
`TRANSFORM_RWA`, at AZURE2's own radii and Coulomb functions — it reproduces the
GUI's Γ_W (7/2⁻ 4.57 ³He+α: 3.487e5 eV, θ² = 0.494).

**γ-ray strengths.** W.u. against the Weisskopf estimates E1 `6.8e-2 A^{2/3}
E³`, E2 `4.9e-8 A^{4/3} E⁵`, M1 `2.1e-2 E³` eV with E in MeV (E1–E4/M1–M4 in
`pyazr/widths.py`). Note Γ is **not** ∝ rwa² for a capture channel — the
external-capture term is linear in the amplitude — so convert with
`transform_rwa`, never by squaring.

**Comparing against an ENDF/B evaluation.** Getting the file: NNDC's own
site (`nndc.bnl.gov`) is JS-rendered and its listings don't come back
through a plain fetch. Use the IAEA mirror instead, which serves flat
static directory listings any `curl` can walk:
`https://www-nds.iaea.org/public/download-endf/<version>/<sublibrary>/`,
e.g. `ENDF-B-VIII.1/p/` for the incident-proton sublibrary. Files are
named `<projectile>_<Z>-<Elem>-<A>_<MAT>.zip`, e.g. `p_006-C-12_0625.zip`
for p+¹²C; sublibrary folders are `n`, `p`, `d`, `t`, `he3`, `he4`, `g`,
`decay`, etc. (`000-NSUB-index.htm` in the version root lists them all).
This mirror occasionally 402s on a first try (also seen fetching AME mass
data from a different IAEA path) — a plain `curl` retry has so far always
succeeded where the fetch tool's own request didn't.

Parsing: `pip install endf` (pure-Python, no compiled deps beyond numpy).
Its high-level `Material.interpret()` does not yet cover the charged-
particle incident sublibraries (`NotImplementedError: No class
implemented for NSUB=10010` for protons, as of endf 0.1.12) — drop to the
section level instead:

```python
import io, endf
mat = endf.Material("p_006-C-12_0625.dat")
print(mat.sections)                       # [(MF, MT), ...] present in the file
sec = endf.mf6.parse_mf6(io.StringIO(mat.section_text[6, 2]))
```

**Elastic scattering of a charged projectile is not in MF=4/MT=2 the way
neutron elastic is.** Coulomb scattering has no finite angle-integrated
cross section, so MF=3/MT=2 cannot hold a real σ(E) — by convention it is
either an unused placeholder (`1.0` at every energy, LTP=1/2) or, for
LTP=12/14, the finite "nuclear-plus-interference" integral σ_NI(E) in
barns (**can be negative** — it is a difference of two cross sections, not
a cross section on its own; don't mistake this for corrupted data). The
actual angular dependence lives in **MF=6/MT=2, LAW=5** ("charged-particle
elastic scattering", ENDF-102 §6.2.7 — the LANL reference page for this
section, `t2.lanl.gov/nis/endf/law5for6.html`, 403s from some networks;
the section is short enough to pull straight from the manual PDF,
`nndc.bnl.gov/endfdocs/ENDF-102-2023.pdf`, pages 144–147 in the 2023
edition). `endf.mf6.parse_mf6` handles LAW=5 already; check `LTP` on each
returned energy point (`dist['distribution'][i]['LTP']`) before assuming
which reconstruction applies — the four representations are not
interchangeable:

- `LTP=1`: nuclear amplitude expansion — complex `a_l(E)` + real `b_l(E)`
  Legendre coefficients (eqs. 6.13/6.14). Full-fidelity but rarely used.
- `LTP=2`: residual cross section as Legendre coefficients (eqs.
  6.15–6.18) — a direct fit to data, degrades at forward angles/low
  energy where the interference term's Legendre representation isn't
  well-behaved.
- `LTP=12` / `LTP=14`: tabulated `(μ, P_NI)` pairs, linear in μ (12) or
  linear in `ln(P_NI)` (14), normalized so `∫P_NI dμ = 1` over the
  tabulated μ range. **This was the ENDF/B-VIII.1 p+¹²C representation.**
  Reconstruct the physical differential cross section as
  `σ(μ,E) = σ_Rutherford(μ,E) + σ_NI(E)·P_NI(μ,E)` for μ inside the
  tabulated range (pure Rutherford outside it), with `σ_NI(E)` read
  straight off MF=3/MT=2 at that energy and `P_NI` linearly interpolated
  on the tabulated μ grid (ENDF-102 eqs. 6.19/6.20).

Rutherford term (ENDF-102 eq. 6.9, confirmed against the standard
nuclear-physics form independently): in the CM frame, with `T_cm` the CM
kinetic energy of relative motion (`T_cm = E_lab · m_target/(m_beam +
m_target)`, the same `cm2lab` factor used everywhere else in this skill)
and `e² = 1.43996 MeV·fm`,

```python
sigma_ruth_fm2 = (Z1 * Z2 * 1.43996 / (4 * T_cm))**2 / np.sin(theta_cm / 2)**4
sigma_ruth_b = sigma_ruth_fm2 / 100.0   # 1 barn = 100 fm^2
```

**Always check the tabulated energy grid before trusting a comparison.**
`dist['distribution'][i]['E']` for every `i` gives the incident lab-energy
grid (eV); light-target proton sublibraries commonly start at **1 MeV**
and have nothing below it, because sub-MeV protons are out of scope for
the transport/dosimetry work these evaluations are built for. That range
can miss the entire resolved-resonance region an R-matrix archive fit was
built to describe — the p+¹²C ENDF/B-VIII.1 file has zero coverage below
1 MeV, so a fit dataset sitting entirely at 0.3–0.6 MeV (as the backward-
angle ¹²C(p,p) data in this archive's `12C+p/8-9-26_claude_learns_12C+p/`
does) has no ENDF curve to compare against at all. Check the overlap
*before* building the plot, not after.

## `.azr` file anatomy

Plain-text, section-tagged; prefer the GUI or `AzrModel` over hand edits.

- `<config>` — A-matrix flag, `output/` and `checks/` dirs, check toggles.
  A-matrix vs R-matrix is **purely a computational-efficiency choice, not a
  physics one** — both formalisms give identical results. A-matrix (level
  matrix) wins with many channels and few levels; R-matrix (channel matrix)
  wins with many levels and few channels.
- `<levels>` — one line **per channel of each level**, 31 fields matching
  `NucLine` (`include/NucLine.h`); the file stores `2J`, `2S`, `2L` as integers.
  Blank line between levels; `levelID` groups them.
- `<segmentsData>` — one line per data segment: `isActive entranceKey exitKey
  minE maxE minA maxA isDiff [phaseJ phaseL] dataNorm varyNorm dataNormError
  [energyShift …] dataFile`. A `+10` on `isDiff` marks a THM/HOES segment.
  **If hand-editing a line (e.g. appending a new segment, flipping a flag)**,
  match the existing fixed-width column formatting exactly — each field padded
  to its own column, not just whitespace-separated. A plain tab-joined line
  parses fine for AZURE2's own engine (any whitespace tokenizes the same) but
  the **GUI's segment editor silently mis-displays/fails to load it correctly**,
  because it expects the columns at fixed character offsets. Diff a hand-edited
  line against an unmodified neighbor before trusting it in the GUI.
- `<segmentsTest>` — extrapolation grids (see above).
- `<targetInt>` — target/experimental effects (integration, convolution) —
  **matched to a `<segmentsData>` or `<segmentsTest>` line purely by its own
  numeric key column, independent of which section that key's line lives in**
  (`EData::ReadTargetEffectsFile`). `<segmentsData>` keys are 1..N in file
  order; `<segmentsTest>` keys are a *separate* 1..M counter, also in file
  order — nothing ties a test segment's key to the data segment it's meant to
  extrapolate. Appending one new `<segmentsTest>` line (by hand, via
  `add_extrapolation`, or `set_extrapolations` — none of the three manage this
  for you) can land on a key some *unrelated* data segment already claims for
  a target effect, silently inheriting that segment's convolution/integration
  treatment instead of the intended one (or none at all). The robust fix used
  in this project: mirror **every** `<segmentsData>` line into `<segmentsTest>`
  1:1, in the same order, all inert (`isActive=0`) by default, so a test
  segment's key always matches its own data segment's key by construction —
  then flip on only the ones actually needed. See
  `R-matrix/11B+a/8-27-26_claude/build_mirrored_test_segments.py` for a
  working implementation (also handles the `isDiff` code remap between the two
  sections, see below).
- `<parameterSettings>` — free/fixed, limits, nuisance, category, Minuit index.
- `<mcmc>` — walkers, steps, threads.

## Data file format (`.dat`)

Four whitespace-delimited columns, **lab frame, forward kinematics**:
energy (MeV) · angle (deg) · cross section (b, or b/sr if differential) ·
uncertainty. The angle column is required even for angle-integrated data (dummy
value). Phase-shift data uses the same layout with the phase (deg) in column 3.
Analyzing-power data uses it with `A_y` (dimensionless, signed) in column 3 —
and its **angle column is centre-of-mass**, not lab.

## Output files (all center-of-mass)

- `AZUREOut_aa=<in>_R=<out>.out` — 9 cols: cm E, excitation E, cm angle, **fit**
  σ, fit S, **data** σ, data σ err, data S, data S err. For an analyzing-power
  segment, cols 4 and 6 hold `A_y` instead of σ (dimensionless, may be negative). `TOTAL_CAPTURE` in place
  of `R=<out>` for summed capture. `.band` files carry the covariance band.
- `AZUREOut_*.extrap` — 5 cols: cm E, excitation E, cm angle, σ, S (mode 3).
- `chiSquared.out` — per-segment χ²/N and norms; last line total χ². **The
  quickest scalar check that a run succeeded.**
- `param.par` initial / `param.sav` best-fit formal params (reload as the
  external parameter file); `parameters.out` physical/observable params.
- `normalizations.out` — fitted segment norms (auto-loaded with `param.sav`).
- `param.errors`, `covariance_matrix.out` — MINOS (mode 4).
- `reactionrates.dat` (mode 5); `samples.mcmc` (mode 6).
- `intEC.dat` / `intEC.extrap` — external-capture integral caches; see the
  golden rule above.

## Verifying a run

`cat output/chiSquared.out` — a finite total χ² and the expected N per segment.
From pyazr: `np.sum(m.calculate_chi2_rwa(m.params_rwa))` must reproduce the
model's known total (record it whenever the `.azr` changes; a jump concentrated
in a handful of datasets can mean a stale `intEC.extrap`, a `param.sav` whose
segment-keyed norm/shift names no longer match a just-edited `<segmentsData>`
(see the renumbering gotcha above), or — rarer, and easy to mistake for one of
the other two — genuine ill-conditioning in a background level that a
`save_fit` round trip's own numerical noise floor is enough to expose). After a
fit, check `param.sav` updated and compare `parameters.out` widths — and their
θ² — against expectations.

**Before submitting a fit job after any structural edit (a segment or level
add/remove) plus a reparameterization (a remapped `param.sav`, a fresh
`save_fit` snapshot), run a plain calculate first** — CLI mode 1 with the new
parameter file, or `m.objective(m.params_rwa)` in pyazr — in a throwaway output
dir, and check the total against the old total adjusted for exactly what
changed (the removed segment's own χ² and N, from the old `chiSquared.out`).
It costs seconds and catches a corrupted starting point before it burns a
50,000-iteration cluster job on it, rather than after.

- A `<targetInt>` (target-effect / resolution) entry is applied to an *extrapolation* segment
  with the same key as well: to compute a bare resonance shape with mode 3, empty the
  `<targetInt>` block first (13C+a/9-9-26_seg92_9halfplus, 2026-09-10). To get the folded
  shape on a fine grid, give a data segment a dummy fine-grid data file and run mode 1.

- A level energy written by `AzrModel.add_level` with 16 significant digits (e.g.
  `3.436212548111519`) made AZURE2 mis-read the model (13N: chi2 x4000, silently); the same
  energy with 8 decimals was fine, and `apply_fit`/bake exports with 18-character energies
  read correctly, so the trigger is the token layout of add_level's lines rather than the
  digit count alone. Round energies to <= 8 decimals before writing a `.azr`
  programmatically (rmfit's level search rounds to 1 eV).

- **Beam-profile (photodissociation / TPC fine-splitting) experimental effect** (added
  2026-09-10, `R-matrix/12C+a_onefile/9-10-26_Haversen_test/`): for data taken in a broad,
  skewed γ beam with event-by-event energy reconstruction (HIγS TPCs), the point-centred
  Gaussian convolution is the wrong kernel — the beam profile is *absolute* and each point is
  an energy slice `[a,b]` of it seen through the detector resolution. `TargetEffect` now has a
  `beamprofile N {xi omega alpha w}xN tpcSigma nCut dbFlag` trailing block on the `<targetInt>`
  line (all energies **lab entrance-channel MeV**; `dbFlag=1` adds the detailed-balance weight
  so a capture cross section is averaged the way the inverse measurement was), the per-point
  window comes from optional **columns 5-6 of the data file**, and
  `AzrModel.add_target_effect(segments, beam_profile=[...], tpc_sigma=..., photodissociation=True)`
  writes it. One segment per nominal beam energy, one targetInt line per segment, mirror the data
  segments as inactive `<segmentsTest>` lines so the keys line up. Also new: isDiff 5/6 (E1/E2-only)
  segments now integrate their component over sub-points (they read a never-set value before).
  Validated against an independent numpy kernel (`kernel_reference.py` there); regression project
  `tests/beam_profile_kernel/`. The GUI reads, edits and writes the tokens too
  ("Include Beam Profile" in the experimental-effect dialog; round trip covered by
  `tests/gui/target_int_tab_test.cpp`), so a project survives a load-and-save there --
  but note the GUI writes the profile numbers with 12 significant digits, against
  pyazr's 17: harmless next to any real beam width, worth knowing if you diff files.

- `<targetInt>` convolution-equation coefficients are bound ASCENDING: TargetEffect.cpp does
  `convolutionEq_.SetParameter(i, convCoefficients[i])` and Equation.cpp resolves `aN` to
  `parameters_[N]`, so the first value in the list is a0 (the lowest power in the equation
  string). Writing them descending silently applies a different resolution -- on 13C+a
  segment 92 it made the applied sigma 20% too wide (0.811 vs 0.675 keV at the resonance)
  and changed a fitted neutron width from 0.61 to 0.44 keV. Check a new entry by evaluating
  sigma at a known energy before trusting a fit that uses it.
