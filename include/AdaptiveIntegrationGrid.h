/*!
 * \brief Adaptive integration grid generator for target integration
 *
 * This class generates intelligent energy grids for target integration that
 * adaptively place more points near resonances and fewer points in smooth regions.
 * The grid generation analyzes the compound nucleus level scheme to identify
 * resonance locations and allocates integration points accordingly.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Resonance-aware: Places finer grids near level energies
 * - Adaptive: Uses fewer points in smooth regions
 * - Bounded: Respects a maximum point limit
 * - Compatible: Designed as a drop-in replacement for uniform grids
